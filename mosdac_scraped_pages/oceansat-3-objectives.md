# OCEANSAT-3 Objectives
  * To ensure the data continuity of Ocean colour and wind vector data to sustain the operational applications.
  * To improve the applications, some additional datasets such as Sea Surface Temperature and more number of bands in Optical region for florescence and in Infrared region for atmospheric corrections are accommodated.
  * To develop / improve related algorithms and data products to serve in well- established application areas and to enhance the mission utility.
