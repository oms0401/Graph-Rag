# Oceansat-3 Introduction
ISRO has launched the EOS-06(Oceansat-3) satellite on 26 Nov 2022 in a polar sun-synchronous orbit at 740km altitude. EOS-06(Oceansat-3) is the third-generation satellite in the Oceansat series. This is to provide continuity services of Oceansat-2 spacecraft with enhanced payload specifications as well as application areas. 
EOS-06(Oceansat-3) has three main instruments, 13-band advanced Ocean Colour Monitor, Ku-band Scatterometer and a 2-channel Sea Surface Temperature Monitor. ARGOS is the fourth provided by French Space Agency (CNES). Unfortunately, the SSTM developed a technical problem in scan mechanism and therefore, not in operation at present.
**Payloads on EOS-06(Oceansat-3) are** :
•Ku-band Scatterometer (SCAT-3)
•13-band Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM-3) 
•2-band Sea Surface Temperature Monitor (SSTM)
•ARGOS by CNES French Space Agency
**Applications planned using EOS-06(Oceansat-3) datasets are as follows** :
  * Marine Resource Management
  * Carbon & Nitrogen Cycling in Ocean
  * Phytoplankton biodiversity
  * Zooplankton & secondary pro
