# Megha Tropiques Objectives
The main objective of the Megha-Tropiques mission is to study the convective systems that influence the tropical weather and climate. The Megha-Tropiques mission goals are as follows:
  * To provide, simultaneous measurements of several elements of the atmospheric water cycle (water vapour, clouds, condensed water in clouds, precipitation and evaporation),
  * To measure the corresponding radiative budget at the top of the atmosphere,
  * To ensure high temporal sampling in order to characterize the life cycle of the convective systems and to obtain significant statistics.


The payloads have swaths of around 1700-200km. It is necessary to measure the above parameters for a minimum duration of 3 years in order to observe the inter-annual variability and getting an opportunity to observe El Nino-type events in the tropics.
The satellite is launched into a non-sun synchronous orbit, unlike other IRS spacecraft. This Megha-Tropiques satellite carries four payloads namely, MADRAS-a microwave imager, SAPHIR-scanning radiometer instrument, SCARAB-scanner for radiative budget and GPS occultation receiver for atmospheric studies. The major orbit parameters are:
Altitude: | 867 km, circular  
---|---  
Inclination: | 20Â°  
Period: | 102.16 minutes  
Repetitivity: | 97 orbits in 7 days  
No. of Orbits Per day: | 14 (approx.)
