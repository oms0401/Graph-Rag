# SARAL-AltiKa Payloads
SARAL carries the following four payloads:
  * Ka-band altimeter with enhanced bandwidth
    * Ionospheric effects are negligible
    * Better vertical resolution (0.3m)
    * Ka-band (35 GHz) authorizes a compact, lightweight instrument easier to accommodate on a wide range of satellite buses.
  * Dual-frequency radiometer (24/37 GHz)
    * Required for tropospheric correction
    * Derived from Madras (Megha-Tropiques) developments.
  * Laser Retro-reflector Array
    * Useful for orbitography and system calibration.
  * DORIS
    * For adequate orbitography performances in low earth orbit
    * Enable to have similar performance as reference missions like T/P, JASON, ENVISAT
    * Required for mean sea level analysis and coastal/inland application.
